        <li>Git init</li>
        <h4>Git init is a very initial step to make a .GIT folder in your working directory. By just typing GIT INIT
            command you can make a .GIT directory in your project. Below here is an example of GIT INIT command and you
            can see a ".git " folder has been initialized in current working directory.</h4>

        <li>Git Status</li>
        <h4>The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see
            which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. Status output
            does not show you any information regarding the committed project history. Below here is an example of GIT
            STATUS command.</h4>
        <img src="/images/git_status.png" class="git-init" alt=""><br>
        <li>Untracked Files</li>
        <h4> Untracked files are the ones still not versioned—”tracked”—by Git. This is the state of new files you add
            to your repository. That basically means Git is aware the file exists, but still hasn't saved it in its
            internal database. Below here is an example of Untracked files highlighted in <span style="color: red;">RED.</span> </h4>
