    <ul>
        <li>GIT INIT</li>
        <h4>Git init is a very initial step to make a .GIT folder in your working directory. By just typing GIT INIT
            command you can make a .GIT directory in your project. Below here is an example of GIT INIT command and you
            can see a ".git " folder has been initialized in current working directory.</h4>

        <li>GIT STATUS</li>
        <h4>The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see
            which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. Status output
            does not show you any information regarding the committed project history. Below here is an example of GIT
            STATUS command.</h4>
        <img src="/images/git_status.png" class="image" alt=""><br>
        <li>UNTRACKED FILES</li>
        <h4> Untracked files are the ones still not versioned—”tracked”—by Git. This is the state of new files you add
            to your repository. That basically means Git is aware the file exists, but still hasn't saved it in its
            internal database. If git status mentions "Untracked files:", you may need to add one or more untracked
            files. This status message is OK. We are up-to-date, there is nothing to commit, but there is still an
            untracked file. Below here is an example of Untracked files highlighted in <span class="spn"
                style="color: white;">RED.</span> </h4>
        <img src="/images/Untracked_files.png" class="image" alt=""><br>
        <li>GIT ADD</li>
        <h4>The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want
            to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the
            repository in any significant way—changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit. By typing "
            GIT ADD . " on the terminal all the files will be added. Again check the status of current working directory
            Now Two files will be ready to be committed as highlighted in <span class="spn-green"
                style="color: white;">GREEN.</span></h4>

        <img src="/images/files_added.png" class="image" alt=""><br>

        <li>GIT COMMIT</li>
        <h4>The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots
            can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it
            to. The git commit command is one of the core primary functions of Git. Prior use of the git add command is
            required to select the changes that will be staged for the next commit. Then git commit is used to create a
            snapshot of the staged changes along a timeline of a Git projects history. To add a Git commit message to
            your commit, you will use the git commit command followed by the -m flag and then your message in quotes.
            Below here is an example of GIT
            COMMIT command with a messege of FIRST COMMIT. </h4>
        <img src="/images/git_commit.png" class="image" alt=""><br>
        <h4>Here a New H1 tag is added in Index.html and its styling is set in style.css. So we will write a meaningful
            messege to make clarity.</h4>
        <img src="/images/git_commit of H1 tag.png" alt=""><br>
        <h4>You can also see that changes of <span class="spn-green" style="color: white;">adding H1 and commit on
                GitHub.</span></h4>
        <img src="/images/git_commit of H1 tag on GitHub.png" class="github-commit-image" alt=""><br>
        <img src="/images/changes of h1 on Github.png" class="image" alt="">


        <li>GIT DIFF</li>
        <h4>Show changes between the working tree and the index or a tree, changes between the index and a tree, changes
            between two trees, changes resulting from a merge, changes between two blob objects, or changes between two
            files on disk. For example in the above example when I introduced a new H1 heading to previous file was
            changed and to identify that difference we need to run " GIT DIFF " on the terminal to see the exact
            changes. Below here ia a demonstration of the new changes as highlighted in <span class="spn-green"
                style="color: white;">GREEN.</span></h4>
        <img src="/images/git_diff to see exact changes in index_html.png" class="image" alt=""><br>
        <h2>More Uses of Git Diff</h2>
        <h3>git diff [options] [--] [path]</h3>
        <h4>This form is to view the changes you made relative to the index (staging area for the next commit). In other
            words, the differences are what you could tell Git to further add to the index but you still haven’t. You
            can stage these changes by using git-add[1].</h4>
        <h3>git diff [options] --no-index [--] path path</h3>
        <h4> This form is to compare the given two paths on the filesystem. You can omit the --no-index option when
            running the command in a working tree controlled by Git and at least one of the paths points outside the
            working tree, or when running the command outside a working tree controlled by Git. This form implies
            --exit-code.

            git diff [options] --cached [--merge-base] [commit] [--] [path…​]
            This form is to view the changes you staged for the next commit relative to the named commit. Typically you
            would want comparison with the latest commit, so if you do not give commit, it defaults to HEAD. If HEAD
            does not exist (e.g. unborn branches) and commit is not given, it shows all staged changes. --staged is a
            synonym of --cached. If --merge-base is given, instead of using commit, use the merge base of commit and
                    HEAD. git diff --cached --merge-base A is equivalent to git diff --cached $(git merge-base A HEAD).
        </h4>









        <li>GIT LOG</li>
        <h4>The git log command shows a list of all the commits made to a repository. You can see the hash of each Git
            commit , the message associated with each commit, and more metadata. This command is useful for displaying
            the history of a repository. The git log command is used to view the history of committed changes within a
            Git repository. Each set of changes made by a developer is recorded as a commit in Git. The git log command
            shows a default output for quickly reviewing the commit history.</h4>

        <li>Branching</li>
        <h4>In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to
            a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how
            small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. By writing " GIT BRANCH NewBRANCH " on the
            terminal resultantly a newBranch will be made.</h4>

        <h4>After the newBranch is made, run " GIT BRANCH " to check in which branch you are currently present in. And
            you can see it is pointing to MASTER Branch as highlighted in <span class="spn-green"
                style="color: white;">GREEN.</span></h4>
        <h4>Run " GIT CHECKOUT NEWBRANCH " to switch to newBranch that is just made. Again run " GIT BRANCH " to check
            in which branch you are currently present in. And
            you can see it is pointing to newBranch Branch as highlighted in <span class="spn-green"
                style="color: white;">GREEN.</span> Below here is an example of all the discussion.</h4>
